## Game Overview
This game is **"grid-based gameplay"** where two players take turns to compete. The goal is for each player to control one of the two available characters: **"Pathfinder"** and **"Caster"**, each with unique abilities that help them survive.

- **Game Mechanics**: 
  - The game is played on a grid, where players take turns making moves.
  - A time-counter ensures each player has a limited amount of time for their turn.
  - Slimes are spawned after each turn, making it increasingly difficult to survive.
  - The game ends when one of the players is eliminated from the grid.
